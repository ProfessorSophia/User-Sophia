keywords: Key shortcut

This was created in 07/11/2024 with the idea to get 
some tests in order to find the best way to start my project.
This will be used as a diary to my tests.

I made the first test using makingcommandKeyboarddealer.py

but it doesn't seem to fit my objectives, it seems shell
is more flexible and less rebuscado (see translation to english).

then I started makingcommandKeyboarddealer.sh making a similar 
propose.

...

I stumble in a wall, because I couldnÂ't figure out how to make such a
Key Shortcut.

then I had this simple idea:
- get a pyhton script to record my keyword inputs
- if some keys are pressed at same time, then it would make something 
happen

then I came back to makingcommandKeyboarddealer.py
this endded up to be the final solution.
Now it seems that we will have to create the following table:

| key_combination | function that is activated |
|  list           |  signifier                 |


Now, I found AutoHotkey tecnoÃlogy, it seems very great to use.
https://www.autohotkey.com

the file createHotkey.ahk was done once again.

foi um sucesso completo!! Desta forma concluÃ­mos que a melhor maneira
Ã© usando createHotkey.ahk

Agora vamos fazer uma research baseada para estudar autohotkey.


Yes I changed my language. No I will not redo this... go to google
translate.

so now I know how to make a AutoHotkey Script able to get hotkeys
and then run a python file using the Syntaxe 

> run, %PATH%
