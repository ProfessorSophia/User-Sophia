# Introduction

This is a project to automate routines used in personal 
research and secretary, meant to be complementary to other softwares.

This was made by my personal usage and with my personal
philosophy and managment (if it seems heterodox and full
of ortography errors, I wouldn't care much).

Some principles to someone who's not in my head:

1. Keep it simple.
2. It has 3 main functions, that takes and input a file or content
and output file or content. One is Begin, Process and Closure.
3. Hopefully everything will be done using keywords, the basic scheme
of keyword would be CNTRL + "letter" + "number". Such that "letter"
signifies the file it's focussed on, and "number", where 1 to Begin,
2 to Process and 3 to Closure.

I hope it's enough. 

Also in test foulder there will be a lot of simple scripts with
this I would like to add in the project. Hopefully someday I would
make a pretty visualizer to this mess.
